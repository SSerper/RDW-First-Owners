# RDW-First-Owners
Extracts first owners of cars from the RDW site

Some pre conditions and have-to-knows:
- Tested with Python 2.7 on a Windows 10 machine
- Script outputs progress on the DOS terminal, when finished a file is written out with the results. 
- Results file is opened for viewing by calling the default text editor of Windows (notepad), when closed, the DOS terminal also closes
- This script is created out of curiousity, to compare the effort to develop it against my old-time favorite scripting language tcl

This script has a standard BSD license, would be nice to refer to my name if you use it.
