# RDW-First-Owners
Extracts first owners of cars from the Dutch RDW site

## Some pre conditions and have-to-knows:
- Tested with Python 2.7 on a Windows 10 machine
- Script outputs progress on the GUI, when finished user can order a summary via the File-menu. 
- This script is created out of curiousity, to compare the effort to develop it against my old-time favorite scripting language tcl/tk

## Limitations
The limiations of the first branch-release has been fixed/updated. Now, an additional compare against the manufacturing date is performed to extract the real "FIRST-TIME" owner of the car.

## This Release
This version has a GUI to follow and control the extraction progress. It's a quick and dirty implementation, so bear with me as I am also still learning the ins & outs of Python...
