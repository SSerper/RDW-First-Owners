# RDW-First-Owners
Extracts first owners of cars from the Dutch RDW site

## Some pre conditions and have-to-knows:
- Tested with Python 2.7 on a Windows 10 machine
- Script outputs progress on the DOS terminal, when finished a file is written out with the results. 
- Results file is opened for viewing by calling the default text editor of Windows (notepad), when closed, the DOS terminal also closes
- This script is created out of curiousity, to compare the effort to develop it against my old-time favorite scripting language tcl

This script has a standard BSD license, would be nice to refer to my name if you use it.

## Limitations
The limiations of the first branch-release has been fixed/updated. Now, an additional compare against the manufacturing date is performed to extract the real "FIRST-TIME" owner of the car.

## This Release
This version has a GUI to follow and control the extraction progress. It's a quick and dirty implementation, so bear with me as I am also still learning the ins & outs of Python...
